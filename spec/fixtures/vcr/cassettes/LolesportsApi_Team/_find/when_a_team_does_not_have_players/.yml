      string: '{"name":"Curse","bio":"Curse''s roster has fluctuated frequently since
        its inception, with even NyJacky gone from the original team. Their Season
        2 performance landed them just shy of the top 3 in North America, a curse
        that would continue even through present-day. After opening with an 8-0 record
        to the spring split, the team began to lose steam and have been on a downward
        decline that not even all-star EdwarD could stave off. EdwarD later returned
        to Gambit in Europe, and Zekent was added as the starting support. Also adding
        the formerly banned player, IWillDominate, both he and Curse sought to prove
        that they were turning over a new leaf in the competitive scene.\r\n\r\nThe
        2014 spring split met Curse with mixed results. They rode out the split in
        the middle of the pack, more consistent than the bottom teams, yet not advanced
        enough to break into the top three. During the split, Curse dropped Zekent
        and briefly fielded Saintvicious in the support role. While he performed well
        individually, Curse didn\u2019t see marked success with this new swap, and
        eventually Saintvicious returned to retirement and Curse picked up Bunny FuFuu
        in the support role. Finishing the split in fourth place, Bunny FuFuu was
        moved to a substitute role in favor of former TSM member, Xpecial. Curse will
        look to the summer split to prove that, with enough time, they can compete
        for the top spot and a trip to the World Championships.  \r\n","noPlayers":"0","roster":[],"logoUrl":"http://riot-web-cdn.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lolesports/s3fs-public/CurseLogos_RGB.png","profileUrl":"http://na.lolesports.com/node/4","teamPhotoUrl":"http://na.lolesports.com/","acronym":"CRS"}'
